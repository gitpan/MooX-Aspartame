NAME
    MooX::Aspartame - it seems sweet, but it probably has long-term adverse
    health effects

SYNOPSIS
       use MooX::Aspartame;
   
       role NamedThing {
          has name => (is => "ro", isa => Str);
       }
   
       class Person with NamedThing;
   
       class Company with NamedThing;
   
       class Employee extends Person {
          has job_title => (is => "rwp", isa => Str);
          has employer  => (is => "rwp", isa => InstanceOf["Company"]);
      
          method change_job ( (Object) $employer, (Str) $title ) {
             $self->_set_job_title($title);
             $self->_set_employer($employer);
          }
      
          method promote ( (Str) $title ) {
             $self->_set_job_title($title);
          }
       }

DESCRIPTION
    This is something like a lightweight MooseX::Declare. It gives you three
    keywords:

    "class"
        Declares a class. By default this uses Moo. But it's possible to
        promote a class to Moose with the "using" option:

           class Employee using Moose { ... }

        Other options for classes are "extends" for setting a parent class,
        and "with" for composing roles.

    "role"
        Declares a role using Moo::Role. This also supports "using Moose",
        and "with".

    "exporter"
        Declares a utilities package. This supports a "providing" option to
        add function names to @EXPORT_OK.

           exporter Utils providing find_person, find_company {
              fun find_person ( (Str) $name ) {
                 ...;
              }
              fun find_company ( (Str) $name ) {
                 ...;
              }
           }
   
           use Utils find_person => { -as => "get_person" };
           my $bob = get_person("Bob");

        Exporters are built using Exporter::TypeTiny.

    Within the packages declared by these keywords, the following features
    are always available:

    *   Perl 5.14 features. (MooX::Aspartame requires Perl 5.14.)

    *   Strictures, including "FATAL" warnings, but not "uninitialized",
        "void", "once" or "numeric" warnings.

    *   Function::Parameters (in strict mode)

    *   Try::Tiny

    *   Types::Standard type constraints

    *   Carp's "confess"

    *   Scalar::Util's "blessed"

    *   Constants for "true" and "false".

    *   namespace::sweep, except within exporters.

    It is possible to inject other functions into all packages using:

       use MooX::Aspartame [
          'List::Util'      => [qw( first reduce )],
          'List::MoreUtils' => [qw( any all none )],
       ];

    In the "outer" package (where MooX::Aspartame is used), Try::Tiny and
    true are provided.
